# LUNA SOL GAME ENGINE

Welcome to my game engine: Luna Sol! I'm working to develop a small 3D game engine (maybe 2D variant to come later?) for my personal hobbies using what I know at this time, then expanding into unknown territory. I hope to develop a game over time using this and learn more about game development and game engines in the process. 

Short term plans this project will be to develop a few simple games:
* 2D and shader simple demos
* 3D basic systems (scene, input, physics)
* UI handling systems

Most of my focus with this engine will be predmoninantly based on 3D graphics. My goals with the engine are to focus on small, light games for now, and expand over time as I learn. I would like to learn more about software development and utilize this engine for both desktop and mobile. As I have more experience with Direct3D 11, I'm going to start with that, and learn other APIs in the background while working on this engine.

I am also planning to make some tutorial videos on how I constructed this all over time üòÖ

# Tools and Requirements

For now I'm planning to utilize C++ 20 modules, and as of now, MSVC seems to have the most well-rounded support for modules over the others as of this writing. With that said, I'm compiling this with MSVC and Visual Studio 2022. There are some libraries I use with vcpkg and nuget. Outside the DirectX SDKs (11 and 12) I also utilize Assimp right now and did have fmt but currently just use the std::fmt. Remnants of it may remain, but I think I removed all fmt includes with std's fmt. I currently don't have a build system setup, but I'm learning how to utilize cmake for it as it seems to have support for modules compared to some of the others. Hopefully I could put that in some day, otherwise I should make an MSVC build script at least. 

## C++ 20 Baseline - Using Modules
I want to try and build a new project with modules. I expect this to be a learning experience and over time this will be updated as I go. 
So with that said, what I am planning to do with modules is utilize:
* Named Modules `e.g. export module foobar`
* Module Partition `e.g. export module foobar:bah`
* Private Module Fragments `module : private;`
* Global Module Fragment

### Goals for Module Usage

I'm not planning to utilize header units currently. It seems to be a bit unreliable and floods the output on MSVC right now (while also not being widely supported) and overall I just don't know if there's a usage for it right now. I plan to roll many of my own modules for everything in this library. My goals and hopes for it are not about potential future benefits when build tools improve but to:
1. Improve clarity and understanding of each module and its purpose in the design
1. Supplement the use of partitions to hopefully break up systems into more smaller chunks that build into a larger system for easier maintainability
1. Utilize private module fragments to reduce bloat of code files. (Simply put no h/cpp separation especially if I feel it's "small enough" to implement.)

Currently I'm using the `.ixx` extension because I'm using Visual Studio as my main development tool. This is because MSVC seems farthest along in support with C++ 20 modules. However, it also is very slow and prone to breaking because of these changes. Over the several updates, I've noticed improvements, so here is hoping it continues to improve for the better. ü§ûüèº

### Module Partitions 

As for module partitions, I currently also use them in the `.ixx` file extension as well. I've seen reason to also include them into `.cpp` or maybe something else. I haven't quite yet determined how I want to continue with that, and so this could change later down the line. 

#### Global Module Fragments

Due to not going with Header Units right now, that means we'll need to use the **Global Module Fragment** in our code. This looks like the following
```cpp
module;
#include <vector> // normal std libraries
#include "my_header.h"// headers of my own
#define NECESSARY_DEFINES // like those needed for Windows.h
export module foo;
```

This is how I plan to support includdes in my modules, and I won't be making use of a precompiled header in this project as well. This is because a precompiled header has been a bit wonky to use, or maybe I just lack experience still. I will revisit this down the road if I ever find out how and see improvements to using it. 

### Module Naming Scheme
When I started, I started with just using a dot notation as my separator and grouping them into categories. `i.e. Data.*** and Math.***` and while that seemed fine overall. I started taking a liking more to partitions as a means of a collective group of modules that provide some functionality within a set of features. `i.e. D3D12Lib that contains various partitions (:) for setting up device, command lists, command queues, etc.`

For now, all files like everything else are **UpperCamelCase** and that will not change. Module files will still respect that, but listed down below are how I will declare and refer to the modules with the `export module [name]` declaration.

I had previously gone working around various naming schemes, but now I'm going to settle on a particular case and hopefully I could refactor with little trouble down the road. 

For now, the modules themselves will match the module name files. In other words the file names and module declartions should always match. 

**RIGHT**

**MyLib.ixx**
```cpp
export module MyLib;
```

**WRONG**

**MyLib.ixx** 
```cpp
export module MyFooBar; // file name and module name differ
```

### To Partition or Not Partition ##
Simply put I would like to utilize partitions a little more than none-partition files. I believe when dealing with larger systems that could bloat a single file, it would be nice to break them up. That way all I need to do is insure that my one module file exports all imports of the partition and then users can simply import that one module file to utilize. 

```cpp
export module D3D12Lib;
export import :Device;
export import :CommandLists;
export import :CommandQueue;
//etc. 
```

The instances where that doesn't make sense, I'll create modules with declarations and utilize private module fragments instead of declaring the changes inline. I don't know if this comes with any sort of compilation benefits, though in theory it should if tooling could ever get there. However, for now I want to keep the files clean with declarations above the private module fragment and implementations within the private module fragment. 

```cpp
export module Foo

export void MyFoo(); // declaration

module : private; // private module fragment

export void MyFoo()
{
    // implementation here
}
```

When doing partitions, these private module fragments cannot happen within partitioned segments. This unfortunately would lead me to having to declare and implement the private module fragment WITHIN the primary module interface. That means I would have to implement the details in one file, which I do not want to do. That's why I know it may not be optimal in terms of compilation, and maybe down the line an issue, but I'm going this route more for maintainability and to reduce bloat in a single file.

**Note: I plan to move this section later into another README group, but for now just dropping my thoughts here**
