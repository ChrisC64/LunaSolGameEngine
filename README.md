# LUNA SOL GAME ENGINE

Welcome to my game engine: Luna Sol! I'm working to develop a small 3D game engine (maybe 2D variant to come later?) for my personal hobbies using what I know at this time, then expanding into unknown territory. I hope to develop a game over time using this and learn more about game development and game engines in the process. 

Short term plans this project will be to develop a few simple games:
* 2D and shader simple demos
* 3D basic systems (scene, input, physics)
* UI handling systems

Most of my focus with this engine will be predmoninantly based on 3D graphics. My goals with the engine are to focus on small, light games for now, and expand over time as I learn. I would like to learn more about software development and utilize this engine for both desktop and mobile. As I have more experience with Direct3D 11, I'm going to start with that, and learn other APIs in the background while working on this engine.

I am also planning to make some tutorial videos on how I constructed this all over time ðŸ˜…
